to the documentation for IBC-Go, the Golang implementation of the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol! Looking for information on ibc-rs? Click here to go to the ibc-rs github repo. The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) is an end-to-end, connection-oriented, stateful protocol for reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between heterogeneous blockchains arranged in an unknown and dynamic topology. IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other. Chains that speak IBC can share any type of data as long as it's encoded in bytes, enabling the industry’s most feature-rich cross-chain interactions. IBC is secure and permissionless. The protocol realizes this interoperability by specifying a set of data structures, abstractions, and semantics that can be implemented by any distributed ledger that satisfies a small set of requirements. IBC can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications that include token transfers, atomic swaps, multi-chain smart contracts (with or without mutually comprehensible VMs), cross-chain account control, and data and code sharding of various kinds.","s":"IBC-Go Documentation","u":"/v9.0.x/","h":"","p":1174},{"i":1177,"t":"The following diagram shows how IBC works at a high level: The transport layer (TAO) provides the necessary infrastructure to establish secure connections and authenticate data packets between chains. The application layer builds on top of the transport layer and defines exactly how data packets should be packaged and interpreted by the sending and receiving chains. IBC provides a reliable, permissionless, and generic base layer (allowing for the secure relaying of data packets), while allowing for composability and modularity with separation of concerns by moving application designs (interpreting and acting upon the packet data) to a higher-level layer. This separation is reflected in the categories: IBC/TAO comprises the Transport, Authentication, and Ordering of packets, i.e. the infrastructure layer. IBC/APP consists of the application handlers for the data packets being passed over the transport layer. These include but are not limited to fungible token transfers (ICS-20), NFT transfers (ICS-721), and interchain accounts (ICS-27). Application module: groups any application, middleware or smart contract that may wrap downstream application handlers to provide enhanced functionality. Note three crucial elements in the diagram: The chains depend on relayers to communicate. Relayers are the \"physical\" connection layer of IBC: off-chain processes responsible for relaying data between two chains running the IBC protocol by scanning the state of each chain, constructing appropriate datagrams, and executing them on the opposite chain as is allowed by the protocol. Many relayers can serve one or more channels to send messages between the chains. Each side of the connection uses the light client of the other chain to quickly verify incoming messages.","s":"High-level overview of IBC","u":"/v9.0.x/","h":"/v9.0.x/#high-level-overview-of-ibc","p":1174},{"i":1180,"t":"A user can query and interact with the Interchain Accounts module using the CLI.

There are two flags available that influence the channel that is created: --version to specify the (JSON-formatted) version string of the channel. For example: {\\\"version\\\":\\\"ics27-1\\\",\\\"encoding\\\":\\\"proto3\\\",\\\"tx_type\\\":\\\"sdk_multi_msg\\\",\\\"controller_connection_id\\\":\\\"connection-0\\\",\\\"host_connection_id\\\":\\\"connection-0\\\"}. Passing a custom version string is useful if you want to specify, for example, the encoding format of the interchain accounts packet data (either proto3 or proto3json). If not specified the controller submodule will generate a default version string. --ordering to specify the ordering of the channel. Available options are order_ordered and order_unordered (default if not specified). Example: simd tx interchain-accounts controller register connection-0 --ordering order_ordered --from cosmos1.. send-tx​ The send-tx command allows users to send a transaction on the provided connection to be executed using an interchain account on the host chain. simd tx interchain-accounts controller send-tx [connection-id] [path/to/packet_msg.json] Example: simd tx interchain-accounts controller send-tx connection-0 packet-data.json --from cosmos1..

To implement an authentication module, the IBCModule interface need not be fulfilled; it is only required to fulfill Cosmos SDK's AppModuleBasic interface, just like any regular Cosmos SDK application module.

When using ORDERED channels, the order of transactions when sending packets from a controller to a host chain is maintained. When using UNORDERED channels, there is no guarantee that the order of transactions when sending packets from the controller to the host chain is maintained. If no ordering is specified in MsgRegisterInterchainAccount, then the default ordering for new ICA channels is UNORDERED. A limitation when using ORDERED channels is that when a packet times out the channel will be closed. In the case of a channel closing, a controller chain needs to be able to regain access to the interchain account registered on this channel. Active Channels enable this functionality. When an Interchain Account is registered using MsgRegisterInterchainAccount, a new channel is created on a particular port. During the OnChanOpenAck and OnChanOpenConfirm steps (on controller & host chain respectively) the Active Channel for this interchain account is stored in state. It is possible to create a new channel using the same controller chain portID if the previously set Active Channel is now in a CLOSED state. This channel creation can be initialized programmatically by sending a new MsgChannelOpenInit message like so: msg := channeltypes.NewMsgChannelOpenInit(portID, string(versionBytes), channeltypes.ORDERED, []string{connectionID}, icatypes.HostPortID, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(icatypes.ModuleName).String()) handler := keeper.msgRouter.Handler(msg) res, err := handler(ctx, msg) if err != nil { return err } Alternatively, any relayer operator may initiate a new channel handshake for this interchain account once the previously set Active Channel is in a CLOSED state. This is done by initiating the channel handshake on the controller chain using the same portID associated with the interchain account in question.

Synopsis Authentication modules play the role of the Base Application as described in ICS-30 IBC Middleware, and enable application developers to perform custom logic when working with the Interchain Accounts controller API. The controller submodule is used for account registration and packet sending. It executes only logic required of all controllers of interchain accounts. The type of authentication used to manage the interchain accounts remains unspecified. There may exist many different types of authentication which are desirable for different use cases. Thus the purpose of the authentication module is to wrap the controller submodule with custom authentication logic. In ibc-go, authentication modules are connected to the controller chain via a middleware stack. The controller submodule is implemented as middleware and the authentication module is connected to the controller submodule as the base application of the middleware stack. To implement an authentication module, the IBCModule interface must be fulfilled. By implementing the controller submodule as middleware, any amount of authentication modules can be created and connected to the controller submodule without writing redundant code. The authentication module must: Authenticate interchain account owners. Track the associated interchain account address for an owner. Send packets on behalf of an owner (after authentication).","s":"Deprecation Notice","u":"/v9.0.x/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/auth-modules/","h":"/v9.0.x/apps/interchain-accounts/legacy/auth-modules/#deprecation-notice","p":1262},{"i":1266,"t":"The following IBCModule callbacks must be implemented with appropriate custom logic: // OnChanOpenInit implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanOpenInit( ctx sdk.Context, order channeltypes.Order, connectionHops []string, portID string, channelID string, counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty, version string, ) (string, error) { // perform custom logic return version, nil } // OnChanOpenAck implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanOpenAck( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, counterpartyVersion string, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnChanCloseConfirm implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnChanCloseConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnAcknowledgementPacket implements the IBCModule interface func (im IBCModule) OnAcknowledgementPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, acknowledgement []byte, relayer sdk.AccAddress, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } // OnTimeoutPacket implements the IBCModule interface. func (im IBCModule) OnTimeoutPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, relayer sdk.AccAddress, ) error { // perform custom logic return nil } The following functions must be defined to fulfill the IBCModule interface, but they will never be called by the controller submodule so they may error or panic.

The IBC protocol doesn't know the topology of the overall network (i.e connections between chains and identifier names between them). For this reason, in the multiple hops case, a particular chain in the timeline of the individual transfers can't query the chain and client identifiers of the other chains. Take for example the following sequence of transfers A -> B -> C for an IBC token, with a final prefix path (trace info) of transfer/channelChainC/transfer/channelChainB. What the paragraph above means is that even in the case that chain C is directly connected to chain A, querying the port and channel identifiers that chain B uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelChainA) can be completely different from the one that chain C uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelToChainA). Thus the proposed solution for clients that the IBC team recommends are the following: Connect to all chains: Connecting to all the chains in the timeline would allow clients to perform the queries outlined in the direct connection section to each relevant chain. By repeatedly following the port and channel denomination trace transfer timeline, clients should always be able to find all the relevant identifiers. This comes at the tradeoff that the client must connect to nodes on each of the chains in order to perform the queries. Relayer as a Service (RaaS): A longer term solution is to use/create a relayer service that could map the denomination trace to the chain path timeline for each token (i.e origin chain -> chain #1 -> ... -> chain #(n-1) -> final chain). These services could provide merkle proofs in order to allow clients to optionally verify the path timeline correctness for themselves by running light clients. If the proofs are not verified, they should be considered as trusted third parties services. Additionally, client would be advised in the future to use RaaS that support the largest number of connections between chains in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, none of the existing public relayers (in Golang and Rust), provide this service to clients. tip The only viable alternative for clients (at the time of writing) to tokens with multiple connection hops, is to connect to all chains directly and perform relevant queries to each of them in the sequence.","s":"Multiple hops","u":"/v9.0.x/apps/transfer/ics20-v1/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/apps/transfer/ics20-v1/overview/#multiple-hops","p":1315},{"i":1331,"t":"In some exceptional cases, a client state associated with a given channel cannot be updated.

Once the proposal passes the client state will be unfrozen and the funds from the associated channels will then be unlocked. This mechanism only applies to clients that allow updates via governance, such as Tendermint clients. In addition to this, it's important to mention that a token must be sent back along the exact route that it took originally in order to return it to its original form on the source chain (eg: the Cosmos Hub for the uatom). Sending a token back to the same chain across a different channel will not move the token back across its timeline.

For example, the token transfer/channelToA/uatom will be displayed as ibc/7F1D3FCF4AE79E1554D670D1AD949A9BA4E4A3C76C63093E17E446A46061A7A2. The human readable denomination is stored using x/bank module's denom metadata feature. You may display the human readable denominations by querying balances with the --resolve-denom flag, as in: simd query bank balances [address] --resolve-denom Each send to any chain other than the one it was previously received from is a movement forwards in the token's timeline. This causes trace to be added to the token's history and the destination port and destination channel to be prefixed to the denomination. In these instances the sender chain is acting as the \"source zone\". When the token is sent back to the chain it previously received from, the prefix is removed. This is a backwards movement in the token's timeline and the sender chain is acting as the \"sink zone\". It is strongly recommended to read the full details of ADR 001: Coin Source Tracing to understand the implications and context of the IBC token representations.","s":"Denomination trace","u":"/v9.0.x/apps/transfer/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/apps/transfer/overview/#denomination-trace","p":1367},{"i":1377,"t":"For clients (wallets, exchanges, applications, block explorers, etc) that want to display the source of the token, it is recommended to use the following alternatives for each of the cases below:","s":"UX suggestions for clients","u":"/v9.0.x/apps/transfer/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/apps/transfer/overview/#ux-suggestions-for-clients","p":1367},{"i":1379,"t":"If the denomination trace contains a single identifier prefix pair (as in the example above), then the easiest way to retrieve the chain and light client identifier is to map the trace information directly.

The IBC protocol doesn't know the topology of the overall network (i.e connections between chains and identifier names between them). For this reason, in the multiple hops case, a particular chain in the timeline of the individual transfers can't query the chain and client identifiers of the other chains. Take for example the following sequence of transfers A -> B -> C for an IBC token, with a final prefix path (trace info) of transfer/channelChainC/transfer/channelChainB. What the paragraph above means is that even in the case that chain C is directly connected to chain A, querying the port and channel identifiers that chain B uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelChainA) can be completely different from the one that chain C uses to connect to chain A (eg: transfer/channelToChainA). Thus the proposed solution for clients that the IBC team recommends are the following: Connect to all chains: Connecting to all the chains in the timeline would allow clients to perform the queries outlined in the direct connection section to each relevant chain. By repeatedly following the port and channel denomination trace transfer timeline, clients should always be able to find all the relevant identifiers. This comes at the tradeoff that the client must connect to nodes on each of the chains in order to perform the queries. Relayer as a Service (RaaS): A longer term solution is to use/create a relayer service that could map the denomination trace to the chain path timeline for each token (i.e origin chain -> chain #1 -> ... -> chain #(n-1) -> final chain). These services could provide merkle proofs in order to allow clients to optionally verify the path timeline correctness for themselves by running light clients. If the proofs are not verified, they should be considered as trusted third parties services. Additionally, client would be advised in the future to use RaaS that support the largest number of connections between chains in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, none of the existing public relayers (in Golang and Rust), provide this service to clients. tip The only viable alternative for clients (at the time of writing) to tokens with multiple connection hops, is to connect to all chains directly and perform relevant queries to each of them in the sequence.","s":"Multiple hops","u":"/v9.0.x/apps/transfer/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/apps/transfer/overview/#multiple-hops","p":1367},{"i":1383,"t":"info Token forwarding and unwinding is supported only on ICS20 v2 transfer channels.

This interface contains all of the callbacks IBC expects modules to implement. This section will describe the callbacks that are called during channel handshake execution. Here are the channel handshake callbacks that modules are expected to implement: // Called by IBC Handler on MsgOpenInit func (k Keeper) OnChanOpenInit(ctx sdk.Context, order channeltypes.Order, connectionHops []string, portID string, channelID string, counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty, version string, ) error { // ... do custom initialization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake // Examples: Abort if order == UNORDERED, // Abort if version is unsupported err := checkArguments(args) return err } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgOpenTry OnChanOpenTry( ctx sdk.Context, order channeltypes.Order, connectionHops []string, portID, channelID string, counterparty channeltypes.Counterparty, counterpartyVersion string, ) (string, error) { // ... do custom initialization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake if err := checkArguments(args); err != nil { return err } // Construct application version // IBC applications must return the appropriate application version // This can be a simple string or it can be a complex version constructed // from the counterpartyVersion and other arguments. // The version returned will be the channel version used for both channel ends. appVersion := negotiateAppVersion(counterpartyVersion, args) return appVersion, nil } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgOpenAck OnChanOpenAck( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, counterpartyVersion string, ) error { // ... do custom initialization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgOpenConfirm OnChanOpenConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // ... do custom initialization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } The channel closing handshake will also invoke module callbacks that can return errors to abort the closing handshake. Closing a channel is a 2-step handshake, the initiating chain calls ChanCloseInit and the finalizing chain calls ChanCloseConfirm. // Called by IBC Handler on MsgCloseInit OnChanCloseInit( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // ... do custom finalization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } // Called by IBC Handler on MsgCloseConfirm OnChanCloseConfirm( ctx sdk.Context, portID, channelID string, ) error { // ... do custom finalization logic // Use above arguments to determine if we want to abort handshake err := checkArguments(args) return err } Channel Handshake Version Negotiation​ Application modules are expected to verify versioning used during the channel handshake procedure. ChanOpenInit callback should verify that the MsgChanOpenInit.Version is valid ChanOpenTry callback should construct the application version used for both channel ends. If no application version can be constructed, it must return an error. ChanOpenAck callback should verify that the MsgChanOpenAck.CounterpartyVersion is valid and supported. IBC expects application modules to perform application version negotiation in OnChanOpenTry. The negotiated version must be returned to core IBC. If the version cannot be negotiated, an error should be returned. Versions must be strings but can implement any versioning structure. If your application plans to have linear releases then semantic versioning is recommended. If your application plans to release various features in between major releases then it is advised to use the same versioning scheme as IBC. This versioning scheme specifies a version identifier and compatible feature set with that identifier. Valid version selection includes selecting a compatible version identifier with a subset of features supported by your application for that version. The struct is used for this scheme can be found in 03-connection/types. Since the version type is a string, applications have the ability to do simple version verification via string matching or they can use the already implemented versioning system and pass the proto encoded version into each handhshake call as necessary. ICS20 currently implements basic string matching with a single supported version.","s":"Implement IBCModule Interface and callbacks","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/apps/apps/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/apps/apps/#implement-ibcmodule-interface-and-callbacks","p":1419},{"i":1427,"t":"Modules connected by a channel must agree on what application data they are sending over the channel, as well as how they will encode/decode it. This process is not specified by IBC as it is up to each application module to determine how to implement this agreement. However, for most applications this will happen as a version negotiation during the channel handshake. While more complex version negotiation is possible to implement inside the channel opening handshake, a very simple version negotiation is implemented in the ibc-transfer module. Thus, a module must define its custom packet data structure, along with a well-defined way to encode and decode it to and from []byte. // Custom packet data defined in application module type CustomPacketData struct { // Custom fields ... } EncodePacketData(packetData CustomPacketData) []byte { // encode packetData to bytes } DecodePacketData(encoded []byte) (CustomPacketData) { // decode from bytes to packet data } Then a module must encode its packet data before sending it through IBC. // Sending custom application packet data data := EncodePacketData(customPacketData) packet.Data = data // Send packet to IBC, authenticating with channelCap sequence, err := IBCChannelKeeper.SendPacket( ctx, sourcePort, sourceChannel, timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, data, ) A module receiving a packet must decode the PacketData into a structure it expects so that it can act on it. // Receiving custom application packet data (in OnRecvPacket) packetData := DecodePacketData(packet.Data) // handle received custom packet data Packet Flow Handling​ Just as IBC expected modules to implement callbacks for channel handshakes, IBC also expects modules to implement callbacks for handling the packet flow through a channel. Once a module A and module B are connected to each other, relayers can start relaying packets and acknowledgements back and forth on the channel. Briefly, a successful packet flow works as follows: module A sends a packet through the IBC module the packet is received by module B if module B writes an acknowledgement of the packet then module A will process the acknowledgement if the packet is not successfully received before the timeout, then module A processes the packet's timeout. Sending Packets​ Modules do not send packets through callbacks, since the modules initiate the action of sending packets to the IBC module, as opposed to other parts of the packet flow where msgs sent to the IBC module must trigger execution on the port-bound module through the use of callbacks. Thus, to send a packet a module simply needs to call SendPacket on the IBCChannelKeeper. // Sending custom application packet data data := EncodePacketData(customPacketData) // Send packet to IBC, authenticating with channelCap sequence, err := IBCChannelKeeper.SendPacket( ctx, sourcePort, sourceChannel, timeoutHeight, timeoutTimestamp, data, ) Receiving Packets​ To handle receiving packets, the module must implement the OnRecvPacket callback. This gets invoked by the IBC module after the packet has been proved valid and correctly processed by the IBC keepers. Thus, the OnRecvPacket callback only needs to worry about making the appropriate state changes given the packet data without worrying about whether the packet is valid or not. Modules may return to the IBC handler an acknowledgement which implements the Acknowledgement interface. The IBC handler will then commit this acknowledgement of the packet so that a relayer may relay the acknowledgement back to the sender module. The state changes that occurred during this callback will only be written if: the acknowledgement was successful as indicated by the Success() function of the acknowledgement if the acknowledgement returned is nil indicating that an asynchronous process is occurring NOTE: Applications which process asynchronous acknowledgements must handle reverting state changes when appropriate. Any state changes that occurred during the OnRecvPacket callback will be written for asynchronous acknowledgements.

In the case where a packet is processed at some later point after the packet has been received (asynchronous execution), the acknowledgement will be written once the packet has been processed by the application which may be well after the packet receipt. NOTE: Most blockchain modules will want to use the synchronous execution model in which the module processes and writes the acknowledgement for a packet as soon as it has been received from the IBC module. This acknowledgement can then be relayed back to the original sender chain, which can take action depending on the contents of the acknowledgement. Just as packet data was opaque to IBC, acknowledgements are similarly opaque. Modules must pass and receive acknowledegments with the IBC modules as byte strings. Thus, modules must agree on how to encode/decode acknowledgements. The process of creating an acknowledgement struct along with encoding and decoding it, is very similar to the packet data example above. ICS 04 specifies a recommended format for acknowledgements. This acknowledgement type can be imported from channel types. While modules may choose arbitrary acknowledgement structs, a default acknowledgement types is provided by IBC here: // Acknowledgement is the recommended acknowledgement format to be used by // app-specific protocols. // NOTE: The field numbers 21 and 22 were explicitly chosen to avoid accidental // conflicts with other protobuf message formats used for acknowledgements. // The first byte of any message with this format will be the non-ASCII values // `0xaa` (result) or `0xb2` (error).

The sender module can then process the acknowledgement using the OnAcknowledgementPacket callback. The contents of the acknowledgement is entirely up to the modules on the channel (just like the packet data); however, it may often contain information on whether the packet was successfully processed along with some additional data that could be useful for remediation if the packet processing failed. Since the modules are responsible for agreeing on an encoding/decoding standard for packet data and acknowledgements, IBC will pass in the acknowledgements as []byte to this callback. The callback is responsible for decoding the acknowledgement and processing it. OnAcknowledgementPacket( ctx sdk.Context, packet channeltypes.Packet, acknowledgement []byte, ) (*sdk.Result, error) { // Decode acknowledgement ack := DecodeAcknowledgement(acknowledgement) // process ack res, err := processAck(ack) return res, err } Timeout Packets​ If the timeout for a packet is reached before the packet is successfully received or the counterparty channel end is closed before the packet is successfully received, then the receiving chain can no longer process it. Thus, the sending chain must process the timeout using OnTimeoutPacket to handle this situation. Again the IBC module will verify that the timeout is indeed valid, so our module only needs to implement the state machine logic for what to do once a timeout is reached and the packet can no longer be received.

NOTE: Most blockchain modules will want to use the synchronous execution model in which the module processes and writes the acknowledgement for a packet as soon as it has been received from the IBC module. This acknowledgement can then be relayed back to the original sender chain, which can take action depending on the contents of the acknowledgement.

Channel upgradability is an IBC-level protocol that allows chains to leverage new application and channel features without having to create new channels or perform a network-wide upgrade. Prior to this feature, developers who wanted to update an application module or add a middleware to their application flow would need to create a new channel in order to use the updated application feature/middleware, resulting in a loss of the accumulated state/liquidity, token fungibility (as the channel ID is encoded in the IBC denom), and any other larger network effects of losing usage of the existing channel from relayers monitoring, etc. With channel upgradability, applications will be able to implement features such as but not limited to: potentially adding denom metadata to tokens, or utilizing the fee middleware, all while maintaining the channels on which they currently operate.

This is enforced by the upgrade protocol and upgrade attempts which try to alter an expected counterparty will fail. On a high level, successful handshake process for channel upgrades works as follows: The chain initiating the upgrade process will propose an upgrade. If the counterparty agrees with the proposal, it will block sends and begin flushing any in-flight packets on its channel end. This flushing process will be covered in more detail below. Upon successful completion of the previous step, the initiating chain will also block packet sends and begin flushing any in-flight packets on its channel end. Once both channel ends have completed flushing packets within the upgrade timeout window, both channel ends can be opened and upgraded to the new channel fields.

This will also set the upgrade timeout for the counterparty (i.e. the timeout before which the counterparty chain must move from FLUSHING to FLUSHCOMPLETE; if it doesn't then the chain will cancel the upgrade and write an error receipt). The timeout is a relative time duration in nanoseconds that can be changed with MsgUpdateParams and by default is 10 minutes. The state will change to FLUSHCOMPLETE once there are no in-flight packets left and the channel end is ready to move to OPEN. This flush state will also have an impact on how a channel upgrade can be cancelled, as detailed below. All other parameters will remain the same during the upgrade handshake until the upgrade handshake completes. When the channel is reset to OPEN on a successful upgrade handshake, the relevant fields on the channel end will be switched over to the UpgradeFields specified in the upgrade. note When transitioning a channel from UNORDERED to ORDERED, new packet sends from the channel end which upgrades first will be incapable of being timed out until the counterparty has finished upgrading. warning Due to the addition of new channel states, packets can still be received and processed in both FLUSHING and FLUSHCOMPLETE states.

Currently, all Cosmos SDK modules contain their own stores, which maintain the state of the application module in an IAVL (immutable AVL) binary merkle tree format. Specifically with regard to IBC, core IBC maintains its own IAVL store, and IBC apps (e.g. transfer) maintain their own dedicated stores. The Cosmos SDK multistore therefore creates a simple merkle tree of all of these IAVL trees, and from each of these individual IAVL tree root hashes it derives a root hash for the application state tree as a whole (the AppHash). For the purposes of ibc-go, there are two types of proofs which are important: existence and non-existence proofs, terms which have been used interchangeably with membership and non-membership proofs. For the purposes of this guide, we will stick with \"existence\" and \"non-existence\".","s":"Existence and non-existence proofs","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/light-clients/proofs/","h":"","p":1580},{"i":1583,"t":"Existence proofs are used in IBC transactions which involve verification of counterparty state for transactions which will result in the writing of provable state.

Some trees (e.g. SMT) may have a sentinel empty child for non-existent keys. In this case, the ICS-23 proof spec should include this EmptyChild so that ICS-23 handles the non-existence proof correctly. In some cases, there is a necessity to \"mock\" non-existence proofs if the counterparty does not have ability to prove absence. Since the verification method is designed to give complete control to client implementations, clients can support chains that do not provide absence proofs by verifying the existence of a non-empty sentinel ABSENCE value.

The Tendermint client is the first and most deployed light client in IBC. It implements the IBC light client module interface to track a counterparty running CometBFT consensus. note Tendermint is the old name of CometBFT which has been retained in IBC to avoid expensive migration costs. The Tendermint client consists of two important structs that keep track of the state of the counterparty chain and allow for future updates. The ClientState struct contains all the parameters necessary for CometBFT header verification. The ConsensusState, on the other hand, is a compressed view of a particular header of the counterparty chain. Unlike off chain light clients, IBC does not store full header. Instead it stores only the information it needs to prove verification of key/value pairs in the counterparty state (i.e. the header AppHash), and the information necessary to use the consensus state as the next root of trust to add a new consensus state to the client (i.e. the header NextValidatorsHash and Timestamp). The relayer provides the full trusted header on UpdateClient, which will get checked against the compressed root-of-trust consensus state. If the trusted header matches a previous consensus state, and the trusted header and new header pass the CometBFT light client update algorithm, then the new header is compressed into a consensus state and added to the IBC client. Each Tendermint Client is composed of a single ClientState keyed on the client ID, and multiple consensus states which are keyed on both the clientID and header height. Relayers can use the consensus states to verify merkle proofs of packet commitments, acknowledgements, and receipts against the AppHash of the counterparty chain in order to enable verified packet flow. If a counterparty chain violates the CometBFT protocol in a way that is detectable to off-chain light clients, this misbehaviour can also be submitted to an IBC client by any off-chain actor. Upon verification of this misbehaviour, the Tendermint IBC Client will freeze, preventing any further packet flow from this malicious chain from occurring. Governance or some other out-of-band protocol may then be used to unwind any damage that has already occurred.","s":"Overview","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/light-clients/tendermint/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/light-clients/tendermint/overview/#overview","p":1641},{"i":1645,"t":"The Tendermint light client is initialized with a ClientState that contains parameters necessary for CometBFT header verification along with a latest height and ConsensusState that encapsulates the application state root of a trusted header that will serve to verify future incoming headers from the counterparty. message ClientState { // human readable chain-id that will be included in header // and signed over by the validator set string chain_id = 1; // trust level is the fraction of the trusted validator set // that must sign over a new untrusted header before it is accepted // it can be a minimum of 1/3 and a maximum of 2/3 // Note these are the bounds of liveness. 1/3 is the minimum // honest stake needed to maintain liveness on a chain, // requiring more than 2/3 to sign over the new header would // break the BFT threshold of allowing 1/3 malicious validators Fraction trust_level = 2; // duration of the period since the LatestTimestamp during which the // submitted headers are valid for update google.protobuf.Duration trusting_period = 3; // duration of the staking unbonding period google.protobuf.Duration unbonding_period = 4; // defines how much new (untrusted) header's Time can drift // into the future relative to our local clock. google.protobuf.Duration max_clock_drift = 5; // Block height when the client was frozen due to a misbehaviour ibc.core.client.v1.Height frozen_height = 6; // Latest height the client was updated to ibc.core.client.v1.Height latest_height = 7; // Proof specifications used in verifying counterparty state repeated cosmos.ics23.v1.ProofSpec proof_specs = 8; // Path at which next upgraded client will be committed. // Each element corresponds to the key for a single CommitmentProof in the // chained proof.

In case the malicious subset of the validators exceeds the trust level of the client, then the client can be deceived into accepting invalid blocks and the connection is no longer secure. The Tendermint client has some mitigations in place to prevent this. If there are two valid blocks signed by the counterparty validator set at the same height [e.g. a valid block signed by an honest subset and an invalid block signed by a malicious one], then these conflicting headers can be submitted to the client as misbehaviour. The client will verify the headers and freeze the client; preventing any future updates and proof verification from succeeding. This effectively halts communication with the compromised counterparty while out-of-band social consensus can unwind any damage done. Similarly, if the timestamps of the headers are not monotonically increasing, this can also be evidence of malicious behaviour and cause the client to freeze.

This means that the safety property of bilateral IBC communication between two chains is dependent on the safety properties of the two chains in question.

For example, if a malicious validator set has taken over more than 2/3 of the validator power on a chain; that malicious validator set can create a single chain of blocks with arbitrary commitment roots and arbitrary commitments to the next validator set. This would seize complete control of the chain and prevent the honest subset from even being able to create a competing honest block. In this case, there is no ability for the IBC Tendermint client solely tracking CometBFT consensus to detect the misbehaviour and freeze the client. The IBC protocol would require out-of-band mechanisms to detect and fix such an egregious safety fault on the counterparty chain. Since the Tendermint light client is only tracking consensus and not also verifying the validity of state transitions, malicious behaviour from a validator set that is beyond the BFT fault threshold is an accepted risk of this light client implementation. The IBC protocol has principles of fault isolation (e.g. all tokens are prefixed by their channel, so tokens from different chains are not mutually fungible) and fault mitigation (e.g. ability to freeze the client if misbehaviour can be detected before complete malicious takeover) that make this risk as minimal as possible.","s":"Security model","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/light-clients/tendermint/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/light-clients/tendermint/overview/#security-model","p":1641},{"i":1655,"t":"As mentioned before in the documentation about implementing the ConsensusState interface, ClientMessage is an interface used to update an IBC client.

IBC clients track the consensus states of other blockchains, along with the proof spec necessary to properly verify proofs against the client's consensus state.

The client identifier is auto generated using the client type and the global client counter appended in the format: {client-type}-{N}. A ClientState should contain chain specific and light client specific information necessary for verifying updates and upgrades to the IBC client. The ClientState may contain information such as chain ID, latest height, proof specs, unbonding periods or the status of the light client. The ClientState should not contain information that is specific to a given block at a certain height, this is the function of the ConsensusState. Each ConsensusState should be associated with a unique block and should be referenced using a height. IBC clients are given a client identifier prefixed store to store their associated client state and consensus states along with any metadata associated with the consensus states. Consensus states are stored using their associated height. The supported IBC clients are: Solo Machine light client: Devices such as phones, browsers, or laptops. Tendermint light client: The default for Cosmos SDK-based chains. Wasm client: Proxy client useful for running light clients written in a Wasm-compilable language.

A revision typically represents a continuous, monotonically increasing range of block-heights. The RevisionHeight represents the height of the chain within the given revision. On any reset of the RevisionHeight—for example, when hard-forking a Tendermint chain, the RevisionNumber will get incremented. This allows IBC clients to distinguish between a block height n of a previous revision of the chain (at revision p) and block-height n of the current revision of the chain (at revision e). Heights that share the same revision number can be compared by simply comparing their respective RevisionHeights. Heights that do not share the same revision number will only be compared using their respective RevisionNumbers. Thus a height h with revision number e+1 will always be greater than a height g with revision number e, REGARDLESS of the difference in revision heights. For example: Height{RevisionNumber: 3, RevisionHeight: 0} > Height{RevisionNumber: 2, RevisionHeight: 100000000000} When a Tendermint chain is running a particular revision, relayers can simply submit headers and proofs with the revision number given by the chain's chainID, and the revision height given by the Tendermint block height. When a chain updates using a hard-fork and resets its block-height, it is responsible for updating its chainID to increment the revision number. IBC Tendermint clients then verifies the revision number against their chainID and treat the RevisionHeight as the Tendermint block-height. Tendermint chains wishing to use revisions to maintain persistent IBC connections even across height-resetting upgrades must format their chainIDs in the following manner: {chainID}-{revision_number}. On any height-resetting upgrade, the chainID MUST be updated with a higher revision number than the previous value. For example: Before upgrade chainID: gaiamainnet-3 After upgrade chainID: gaiamainnet-4 Clients that do not require revisions, such as the 06-solomachine client, can simply hardcode 0 into the revision number whenever they need to return an IBC height when implementing IBC interfaces and use the RevisionHeight exclusively. Other client types can implement their own logic to verify the IBC heights that relayers provide in their Update, Misbehavior, and Verify functions respectively.

The connection handshake is responsible for verifying that the light clients on each chain are correct for their respective counterparties. Connections, once established, are responsible for facilitating all cross-chain verifications of IBC state. A connection can be associated with any number of channels. The connection handshake is a 4-step handshake. Briefly, if a given chain A wants to open a connection with chain B using already established light clients on both chains: chain A sends a ConnectionOpenInit message to signal a connection initialization attempt with chain B. chain B sends a ConnectionOpenTry message to try opening the connection on chain A. chain A sends a ConnectionOpenAck message to mark its connection end state as open. chain B sends a ConnectionOpenConfirm message to mark its connection end state as open. Time delayed connections​ Connections can be opened with a time delay by setting the delay_period field (in nanoseconds) in the MsgConnectionOpenInit. The time delay is used to require that the underlying light clients have been updated to a certain height before commitment verification can be performed. delayPeriod is used in conjunction with the max_expected_time_per_block parameter of the connection submodule to determine the blockDelay, which is number of blocks that the connection must be delayed by. When commitment verification is performed, the connection submodule will pass delayPeriod and blockDelay to the light client.

This requirement prevents a malicious module from opening channels with ports it does not own. Thus, IBC modules are responsible for claiming the capability that is returned on BindPort.","s":"Ports","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/#ports","p":1803},{"i":1819,"t":"An IBC channel can be established between two IBC ports. Currently, a port is exclusively owned by a single module. IBC packets are sent over channels. Just as IP packets contain the destination IP address and IP port, and the source IP address and source IP port, IBC packets contain the destination port ID and channel ID, and the source port ID and channel ID. This packet structure enables IBC to correctly route packets to the destination module while allowing modules receiving packets to know the sender module. A channel can be ORDERED, where packets from a sending module must be processed by the receiving module in the order they were sent. Or a channel can be UNORDERED, where packets from a sending module are processed in the order they arrive (might be in a different order than they were sent). Modules can choose which channels they wish to communicate over with, thus IBC expects modules to implement callbacks that are called during the channel handshake. These callbacks can do custom channel initialization logic. If any callback returns an error, the channel handshake fails. Thus, by returning errors on callbacks, modules can programmatically reject and accept channels. The channel handshake is a 4-step handshake. Briefly, if a given chain A wants to open a channel with chain B using an already established connection: chain A sends a ChanOpenInit message to signal a channel initialization attempt with chain B. chain B sends a ChanOpenTry message to try opening the channel on chain A. chain A sends a ChanOpenAck message to mark its channel end status as open. chain B sends a ChanOpenConfirm message to mark its channel end status as open. If all handshake steps are successful, the channel is opened on both sides. At each step in the handshake, the module associated with the ChannelEnd executes its callback. So on ChanOpenInit, the module on chain A executes its callback OnChanOpenInit. The channel identifier is auto derived in the format: channel-{N} where N is the next sequence to be used. Closing channels​ Closing a channel occurs in 2 handshake steps as defined in ICS 04. Once a channel is closed, it cannot be reopened. The channel handshake steps are: ChanCloseInit closes a channel on the executing chain if the channel exists and it is not already closed, the connection it exists upon is OPEN, the IBC module callback OnChanCloseInit returns nil. ChanCloseInit can be initiated by any user by submitting a MsgChannelCloseInit transaction. Note that channels are automatically closed when a packet times out on an ORDERED channel. A timeout on an ORDERED channel skips the ChanCloseInit step and immediately closes the channel. ChanCloseConfirm is a response to a counterparty channel executing ChanCloseInit. The channel on the executing chain closes if the channel exists and is not already closed, the connection the channel exists upon is OPEN, the executing chain successfully verifies that the counterparty channel has been closed the IBC module callback OnChanCloseConfirm returns nil. Currently, none of the IBC applications provided in ibc-go support ChanCloseInit.","s":"Channels","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/#channels","p":1803},{"i":1821,"t":"Modules communicate with each other by sending packets over IBC channels. All IBC packets contain the destination portID and channelID along with the source portID and channelID. This packet structure allows modules to know the sender module of a given packet. IBC packets contain a sequence to optionally enforce ordering. IBC packets also contain a TimeoutHeight and a TimeoutTimestamp that determine the deadline before the receiving module must process a packet. Modules send custom application data to each other inside the Data []byte field of the IBC packet. Thus, packet data is opaque to IBC handlers. It is incumbent on a sender module to encode their application-specific packet information into the Data field of packets. The receiver module must decode that Data back to the original application data.","s":"Packets","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/#packets","p":1803},{"i":1823,"t":"Since IBC works over a distributed network and relies on potentially faulty relayers to relay messages between ledgers, IBC must handle the case where a packet does not get sent to its destination in a timely manner or at all. Packets must specify a non-zero value for timeout height (TimeoutHeight) or timeout timestamp (TimeoutTimestamp ) after which a packet can no longer be successfully received on the destination chain. The timeoutHeight indicates a consensus height on the destination chain after which the packet is no longer to be processed, and instead counts as having timed-out. The timeoutTimestamp indicates a timestamp on the destination chain after which the packet is no longer to be processed, and instead counts as having timed-out. If the timeout passes without the packet being successfully received, the packet can no longer be received on the destination chain. The sending module can timeout the packet and take appropriate actions. If the timeout is reached, then a proof of packet timeout can be submitted to the original chain. The original chain can then perform application-specific logic to timeout the packet, perhaps by rolling back the packet send changes (refunding senders any locked funds, etc). In ORDERED channels, a timeout of a single packet in the channel causes the channel to close. If packet sequence n times out, then a packet at sequence k > n cannot be received without violating the contract of ORDERED channels that packets are processed in the order that they are sent. Since ORDERED channels enforce this invariant, a proof that sequence n has not been received on the destination chain by the specified timeout of packet n is sufficient to timeout packet n and close the channel. In UNORDERED channels, the application-specific timeout logic for that packet is applied and the channel is not closed. Packets can be received in any order. IBC writes a packet receipt for each sequence received in the UNORDERED channel. This receipt does not contain information; it is simply a marker intended to signify that the UNORDERED channel has received a packet at the specified sequence. To timeout a packet on an UNORDERED channel, a proof is required that a packet receipt does not exist for the packet's sequence by the specified timeout. For this reason, most modules should use UNORDERED channels as they require fewer liveness guarantees to function effectively for users of that channel.","s":"Receipts and timeouts","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/#receipts-and-timeouts","p":1803},{"i":1825,"t":"Modules can also choose to write application-specific acknowledgments upon processing a packet.

This acknowledgment data is opaque to IBC much like the packet Data and is treated by IBC as a simple byte string []byte. Receiver modules must encode their acknowledgment so that the sender module can decode it correctly. The encoding must be negotiated between the two parties during version negotiation in the channel handshake. The acknowledgment can encode whether the packet processing succeeded or failed, along with additional information that allows the sender module to take appropriate action. After the acknowledgment has been written by the receiving chain, a relayer relays the acknowledgment back to the original sender module. The original sender module then executes application-specific acknowledgment logic using the contents of the acknowledgment. After an acknowledgement fails, packet-send changes can be rolled back (for example, refunding senders in ICS 20). After an acknowledgment is received successfully on the original sender on the chain, the corresponding packet commitment is deleted since it is no longer needed.","s":"Acknowledgments","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/#acknowledgments","p":1803},{"i":1827,"t":"If you want to learn more about IBC, check the following specifications: IBC specification overview","s":"Further readings and specs","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/overview/#further-readings-and-specs","p":1803},{"i":1829,"t":"Learn how to integrate the 08-wasm module in a chain binary and about the recommended approaches depending on whether the x/wasm module is already used in the chain.

WithQueryPlugins​ By default, the 08-wasm module does not configure any querier options for light client contracts. However, it is possible to register custom query plugins for QueryRequest::Custom and QueryRequest::Stargate. Assuming that the keeper is not yet instantiated, the following sample code shows how to register query plugins for the 08-wasm module. We first construct a QueryPlugins object with the desired query plugins: queryPlugins := ibcwasmtypes.QueryPlugins { Custom: MyCustomQueryPlugin(), // `myAcceptList` is a `[]string` containing the list of gRPC query paths that the chain wants to allow for the `08-wasm` module to query. // These queries must be registered in the chain's gRPC query router, be deterministic, and track their gas usage. // The `AcceptListStargateQuerier` function will return a query plugin that will only allow queries for the paths in the `myAcceptList`. // The query responses are encoded in protobuf unlike the implementation in `x/wasm`. Stargate: ibcwasmtypes.AcceptListStargateQuerier(myAcceptList), } Note that the Stargate querier appends the user defined accept list of query routes to a default list defined by the 08-wasm module. The defaultAcceptList defines a single query route: \"/ibc.core.client.v1.Query/VerifyMembership\". This allows for light client smart contracts to delegate parts of their workflow to other light clients for auxiliary proof verification. For example, proof of inclusion of block and tx data by a data availability provider. // defaultAcceptList defines a set of default allowed queries made available to the Querier. var defaultAcceptList = []string{ \"/ibc.core.client.v1.Query/VerifyMembership\", } You may leave any of the fields in the QueryPlugins object as nil if you do not want to register a query plugin for that query type. Then, we pass the QueryPlugins object to the WithQueryPlugins option: querierOption := ibcwasmkeeper.WithQueryPlugins(&queryPlugins) Finally, we pass the option to the NewKeeperWithConfig or NewKeeperWithVM constructor function during Keeper instantiation: app.WasmClientKeeper = ibcwasmkeeper.NewKeeperWithConfig( appCodec, runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcwasmtypes.StoreKey]), app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(), wasmConfig, app.GRPCQueryRouter(), + querierOption, ) app.WasmClientKeeper = ibcwasmkeeper.NewKeeperWithVM( appCodec, runtime.NewKVStoreService(keys[ibcwasmtypes.StoreKey]), app.IBCKeeper.ClientKeeper, authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(), wasmer, // pass the Wasm VM instance to `08-wasm` keeper constructor app.GRPCQueryRouter(), + querierOption, )","s":"Options","u":"/v9.0.x/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/","h":"/v9.0.x/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/#options","p":1828},{"i":1843,"t":"If the chain's 02-client submodule parameter AllowedClients contains the single wildcard \"*\" element, then it is not necessary to do anything in order to allow the creation of 08-wasm clients.

The light client can now be updated with two valid, but conflicting headers at the same height. The light client cannot know which header is trustworthy and therefore evidence of such misbehaviour is likely to be submitted resulting in a frozen light client. Frozen light clients cannot be updated under any circumstance except via a governance proposal. Since a quorum of validators can sign arbitrary state roots which may not be valid executions of the state machine, a governance proposal has been added to ease the complexity of unfreezing or updating clients which have become \"stuck\". Without this mechanism, validator sets would need to construct a state root to unfreeze the client. Unfreezing clients, re-enables all of the channels built upon that client. This may result in recovery of otherwise lost funds. Tendermint light clients may become expired if the trusting period has passed since their last update. This may occur if relayers stop submitting headers to update the clients. An unplanned upgrade by the counterparty chain may also result in expired clients. If the counterparty chain undergoes an unplanned upgrade, there may be no commitment to that upgrade signed by the validator set before the chain ID changes.

The application version may as well be a JSON-encoded string, possibly including further middleware and app versions, if the application stack consists of multiple milddlewares wrapping a base application. The format of the version is specified in ICS-30 as the following: { \"<middleware_version_key>\": \"<middleware_version_value>\", \"app_version\": \"<application_version_value>\" } The <middleware_version_key> key in the JSON struct should be replaced by the actual name of the key for the corresponding middleware (e.g. fee_version). During the handshake callbacks, the middleware can unmarshal the version string and retrieve the middleware and application versions. It can do its negotiation logic on <middleware_version_value>, and pass the <application_version_value> to the underlying application. NOTE: Middleware that does not need to negotiate with a counterparty middleware on the remote stack will not implement the version unmarshalling and negotiation, and will simply perform its own custom logic on the callbacks without relying on the counterparty behaving similarly.

However, we are now seeing the desire for secondary applications (e.g. smart contracts, modules) to call into IBC apps as part of their state machine logic and then do some actions on packet lifecycle events. The Callbacks Middleware allows for this functionality by allowing the packets of the underlying IBC applications to register callbacks to secondary applications for lifecycle events.

Think of the Callbacks Middleware as a bridge between core IBC and a secondary application. We have the following definitions: Underlying IBC application: The IBC application that is wrapped by the Callbacks Middleware. This is the IBC application that is actually sending and receiving packet lifecycle events from core IBC. For example, the transfer module, or the ICA controller submodule. IBC Actor: IBC Actor is an on-chain or off-chain entity that can initiate a packet on the underlying IBC application. For example, a smart contract, an off-chain user, or a module that sends a transfer packet are all IBC Actors. Secondary application: The application that is being called into by the Callbacks Middleware for packet lifecycle events. This is the application that is receiving the callback directly from the Callbacks Middleware module. For example, the x/wasm module. Callback Actor: The on-chain smart contract or module that is registered to receive callbacks from the secondary application. For example, a Wasm smart contract (gatekeeped by the x/wasm module). Note that the Callback Actor is not necessarily the same as the IBC Actor. For example, an off-chain user can initiate a packet on the underlying IBC application, but the Callback Actor could be a smart contract. The secondary application may want to check that the IBC Actor is allowed to call into the Callback Actor, for example, by checking that the IBC Actor is the same as the Callback Actor. Callback Address: Address of the Callback Actor. This is the address that the secondary application will call into when a packet lifecycle event occurs. For example, the address of the Wasm smart contract. Maximum gas limit: The maximum amount of gas that the Callbacks Middleware will allow the secondary application to use when it executes its custom logic. User defined gas limit: The amount of gas that the IBC Actor wants to allow the secondary application to use when it executes its custom logic. This is the gas limit that the IBC Actor specifies when it sends a packet to the underlying IBC application. This cannot be greater than the maximum gas limit. Think of the secondary application as a bridge between the Callbacks Middleware and the Callback Actor. The secondary application is responsible for executing the custom logic of the Callback Actor when a packet lifecycle event occurs. The secondary application is also responsible for checking that the IBC Actor is allowed to call into the Callback Actor.

Maximum gas limit is hardcoded manually during wiring. It requires a coordinated upgrade to change the maximum gas limit. The receive packet callback does not pass the relayer address to the secondary application. This is so that we can use the same callback for both synchronous and asynchronous acknowledgements. The receive packet callback does not pass IBC Actor's address, this is because the IBC Actor lives in the counterparty chain and cannot be trusted. warning If the callbacks middleware wraps the transfer application, we strongly discourage the usage of source callbacks if MsgTransfer includes forwarding information (which is only supported from ICS20 v2). Source callback information will be executed on the last hop before the destination chain, not on the sending chain. The explanation for this behaviour is that, if the tokens are routed through intermediary chains, then the transfer application on the sending chain will construct a packet data where the memo field is empty, and any memo string included in MsgTransfer is placed in the destination_memo field. This makes it impossible to trigger the source callbacks on the sending chain, since the memo string is not available in the memo field. Then, on the chain before the final destination chain, the transfer application will construct the packet data with the memo string back in the memo field, so that it can be consumed by the callbacks middleware on the destination chain. However, if the memo field of FungibleTokenPacketDataV2 is not empty on the chain before the final destination and the transfer application on that chain is wrapped by callbacks middleware, then the source callbacks would be triggered. Therefore, in order to prevent this unexpected behaviour (i.e. source callbacks triggered not on sending chain, but on the intermediary chain before the final destination) we are strongly recommeding to not include source callbacks information in the memo field of MsgTransfer.","s":"Known Limitations","u":"/v9.0.x/middleware/callbacks/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/middleware/callbacks/overview/#known-limitations","p":1975},{"i":1984,"t":"Synopsis Learn how to incentivize IBC packets using the ICS29 Fee Middleware module. note Pre-requisite readings​ Fee Middleware","s":"For end users","u":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/end-users/","h":"","p":1983},{"i":1986,"t":"Fee Middleware","s":"Pre-requisite readings","u":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/end-users/","h":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/end-users/#pre-requisite-readings","p":1983},{"i":1988,"t":"Different types of end users: CLI users who want to manually incentivize IBC packets Client developers The Fee Middleware module allows end users to add a 'tip' to each IBC packet which will incentivize relayer operators to relay packets between chains. gRPC endpoints are exposed for client developers as well as a simple CLI for manually incentivizing IBC packets.","s":"Summary","u":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/end-users/","h":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/end-users/#summary","p":1983},{"i":1990,"t":"For an in depth guide on how to use the ICS29 Fee Middleware module using the CLI please take a look at the wiki on the ibc-go repo.","s":"CLI Users","u":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/end-users/","h":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/end-users/#cli-users","p":1983},{"i":1992,"t":"Client developers can read more about the relevant ICS29 message types in the Fee messages section.

Though relaying is permissionless and completely decentralized and accessible, it does come with operational costs. Running full nodes to query transaction proofs and paying for transaction fees associated with IBC packets are two of the primary cost burdens which have driven the overall discussion on a general, in-protocol incentivization mechanism for relayers. Initially, a simple proposal was created to incentivize relaying on ICS20 token transfers on the destination chain. However, the proposal was specific to ICS20 token transfers and would have to be reimplemented in this format on every other IBC application module. After much discussion, the proposal was expanded to a general incentivisation design that can be adopted by any ICS application protocol as middleware.","s":"What is the Fee Middleware module?","u":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/overview/","h":"/v9.0.x/middleware/ics29-fee/overview/#what-is-the-fee-middleware-module","p":2037},{"i":2042,"t":"ICS29 fee payments in this middleware design are built on the assumption that sender chains are the source of incentives — the chain on which packets are incentivized is the chain that distributes fees to relayer operators. However, as part of the IBC packet flow, messages have to be submitted on both sender and destination chains. This introduces the requirement of a mapping of relayer operator's addresses on both chains. To achieve the stated requirements, the fee middleware module has two main groups of functionality: Registering of relayer addresses associated with each party involved in relaying the packet on the source chain. This registration process can be automated on start up of relayer infrastructure and happens only once, not every packet flow. This is described in the Fee distribution section. Escrowing fees by any party which will be paid out to each rightful party on completion of the packet lifecycle. This is described in the Fee messages section.

Forward relayer: The relayer that submits the MsgRecvPacket message for a given packet (on the destination chain). Reverse relayer: The relayer that submits the MsgAcknowledgement message for a given packet (on the source chain). Timeout relayer: The relayer that submits the MsgTimeout or MsgTimeoutOnClose messages for a given packet (on the source chain). Payee: The account address on the source chain to be paid on completion of the packet lifecycle. The packet lifecycle on the source chain completes with the receipt of a MsgTimeout/MsgTimeoutOnClose or a MsgAcknowledgement. Counterparty payee: The account address to be paid on completion of the packet lifecycle on the destination chain. The package lifecycle on the destination chain completes with a successful MsgRecvPacket. Refund address: The address of the account paying for the incentivization of packet relaying.

The Base Application was intended to be composed with the ICS27 controller submodule Keeper and facilitate many forms of message authentication depending on a chain's particular use case. Prior to ibc-go v6 the controller submodule exposed only these two functions (to which we will refer as the legacy APIs): RegisterInterchainAccount SendTx However, these functions have now been deprecated in favour of the new controller submodule MsgServer and will be removed in later releases. Both APIs remain functional and maintain backwards compatibility in ibc-go v6, however consumers of these APIs are now recommended to follow the message passing paradigm outlined in Cosmos SDK ADR 031 and ADR 033. This is facilitated by the Cosmos SDK MsgServiceRouter and chain developers creating custom application logic can now omit the ICS27 controller submodule Keeper from their module and instead depend on message routing. Depending on the use case, developers of custom authentication modules face one of three scenarios: My authentication module needs to access IBC packet callbacks Application developers that wish to consume IBC packet callbacks and react upon packet acknowledgements must continue using the controller submodule's legacy APIs. The authentication modules will not need a ScopedKeeper anymore, though, because the channel capability will be claimed by the controller submodule. For example, given an Interchain Accounts authentication module keeper ICAAuthKeeper, the authentication module's ScopedKeeper (scopedICAAuthKeeper) is not needed anymore and can be removed for the argument list of the keeper constructor function, as shown here: app.ICAAuthKeeper = icaauthkeeper.NewKeeper( appCodec, keys[icaauthtypes.StoreKey], app.ICAControllerKeeper, - scopedICAAuthKeeper, ) Please note that the authentication module's ScopedKeeper name is still needed as part of the channel capability migration described in section Upgrade proposal above. Therefore the authentication module's ScopedKeeper cannot be completely removed from the chain code until the migration has run. In the future, the use of the legacy APIs for accessing packet callbacks will be replaced by IBC Actor Callbacks (see ADR 008 for more details) and it will also be possible to access them with the MsgServiceRouter. My authentication module does not need access to IBC packet callbacks The authentication module can migrate from using the legacy APIs and it can be composed instead with the MsgServiceRouter, so that the authentication module is able to pass messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer to register interchain accounts and send packets to the interchain account. For example, given an Interchain Accounts authentication module keeper ICAAuthKeeper, the ICS27 controller submodule keeper (ICAControllerKeeper) and authentication module scoped keeper (scopedICAAuthKeeper) are not needed anymore and can be replaced with the MsgServiceRouter, as shown here: app.ICAAuthKeeper = icaauthkeeper.NewKeeper( appCodec, keys[icaauthtypes.StoreKey], - app.ICAControllerKeeper, - scopedICAAuthKeeper, + app.MsgServiceRouter(), ) In your authentication module you can route messages to the controller submodule's MsgServer instead of using the legacy APIs. For example, for registering an interchain account: - if err := keeper.icaControllerKeeper.RegisterInterchainAccount( - ctx, - connectionID, - owner.String(), - version, - ); err != nil { - return err - } + msg := controllertypes.NewMsgRegisterInterchainAccount( + connectionID, + owner.String(), + version, + ) + handler := keeper.msgRouter.Handler(msg) + res, err := handler(ctx, msg) + if err != nil { + return err + } where controllertypes is an import alias for \"github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/v6/modules/apps/27-interchain-accounts/controller/types\". In addition, in this use case the authentication module does not need to implement the IBCModule interface anymore. I do not need a custom authentication module anymore If your authentication module does not have any extra functionality compared to the default authentication module added in ibc-go v6 (the MsgServer), or if you can use a generic authentication module, such as the x/auth, x/gov or x/group modules from the Cosmos SDK (v0.46 and later), then you can remove your authentication module completely and use instead the gRPC endpoints of the MsgServer or the CLI added in ibc-go v6. Please remember that the authentication module's ScopedKeeper name is still needed as part of the channel capability migration described in section Upgrade proposal above. Host params​ The ICS27 host submodule default params have been updated to include the AllowAllHostMsgs wildcard *. This enables execution of any sdk.Msg type for ICS27 registered on the host chain InterfaceRegistry. // AllowAllHostMsgs holds the string key that allows all message types on interchain accounts host module const AllowAllHostMsgs = \"*\" ... // DefaultParams is the default parameter configuration for the host submodule func DefaultParams() Params { - return NewParams(DefaultHostEnabled, nil) + return NewParams(DefaultHostEnabled, []string{AllowAllHostMsgs}) } API breaking changes​ SerializeCosmosTx takes in a []proto.Message instead of []sdk.Message. This allows for the serialization of proto messages without requiring the fulfillment of the sdk.Msg interface. The 27-interchain-accounts genesis types have been moved to their own package: modules/apps/27-interchain-acccounts/genesis/types. This change facilitates the addition of the ICS27 controller submodule MsgServer and avoids cyclic imports. This should have minimal disruption to chain developers integrating 27-interchain-accounts. The ICS27 host submodule NewKeeper function in modules/apps/27-interchain-acccounts/host/keeper now includes an additional parameter of type ICS4Wrapper. This provides the host submodule with the ability to correctly unwrap channel versions in the event of a channel reopening handshake. func NewKeeper( cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, paramSpace paramtypes.Subspace, - channelKeeper icatypes.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper icatypes.PortKeeper, + ics4Wrapper icatypes.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper icatypes.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper icatypes.PortKeeper, accountKeeper icatypes.AccountKeeper, scopedKeeper icatypes.ScopedKeeper, msgRouter icatypes.MessageRouter, ) Keeper","s":"ICS27 - Interchain Accounts","u":"/v9.0.x/migrations/v5-to-v6/","h":"/v9.0.x/migrations/v5-to-v6/#ics27---interchain-accounts","p":2144},{"i":2154,"t":"The NewKeeper function of ICS29 has been updated to remove the paramSpace parameter as it was unused. func NewKeeper( - cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, paramSpace paramtypes.Subspace, - ics4Wrapper types.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper types.ChannelKeeper, portKeeper types.PortKeeper, authKeeper types.AccountKeeper, bankKeeper types.BankKeeper, + cdc codec.BinaryCodec, key storetypes.StoreKey, + ics4Wrapper types.ICS4Wrapper, channelKeeper types.ChannelKeeper, + portKeeper types.PortKeeper, authKeeper types.AccountKeeper, bankKeeper types.BankKeeper, ) Keeper {","s":"ICS29 - NewKeeper API change","u":"/v9.0.x/migrations/v5-to-v6/","h":"/v9.0.x/migrations/v5-to-v6/#ics29---newkeeper-api-change","p":2144},{"i":2156,"t":"The SendTransfer function of ICS20 has been removed.

The client state and consensus state return values have been removed. Light clients must handle all management of client and consensus states including the setting of updated client state and consensus state in the client store. The Initialize method is now expected to set the initial client state, consensus state and any client-specific metadata in the provided store upon client creation. The CheckHeaderAndUpdateState method has been split into 4 new methods: VerifyClientMessage verifies a ClientMessage. A ClientMessage could be a Header, Misbehaviour, or batch update. Calls to CheckForMisbehaviour, UpdateState, and UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour will assume that the content of the ClientMessage has been verified and can be trusted. An error should be returned if the ClientMessage fails to verify. CheckForMisbehaviour checks for evidence of a misbehaviour in Header or Misbehaviour types. UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour performs appropriate state changes on a ClientState given that misbehaviour has been detected and verified. UpdateState updates and stores as necessary any associated information for an IBC client, such as the ClientState and corresponding ConsensusState. An error is returned if ClientMessage is of type Misbehaviour. Upon successful update, a list containing the updated consensus state height is returned. The CheckMisbehaviourAndUpdateState function has been removed from ClientState interface. This functionality is now encapsulated by the usage of VerifyClientMessage, CheckForMisbehaviour, UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour. The function GetTimestampAtHeight has been added to the ClientState interface. It should return the timestamp for a consensus state associated with the provided height. Prior to ibc-go/v7 the ClientState interface defined a method for each data type which was being verified in the counterparty state store. The state verification functions for all IBC data types have been consolidated into two generic methods, VerifyMembership and VerifyNonMembership. Both are expected to be provided with a standardised key path, exported.Path, as defined in ICS 24 host requirements. Membership verification requires callers to provide the marshalled value []byte. Delay period values should be zero for non-packet processing verification. A zero proof height is now allowed by core IBC and may be passed into VerifyMembership and VerifyNonMembership. Light clients are responsible for returning an error if a zero proof height is invalid behaviour. See below for an example of how ibc-go now performs channel state verification. merklePath := commitmenttypes.NewMerklePath(host.ChannelPath(portID, channelID)) merklePath, err := commitmenttypes.ApplyPrefix(connection.GetCounterparty().GetPrefix(), merklePath) if err != nil { return err } channelEnd, ok := channel.(channeltypes.Channel) if !ok { return sdkerrors.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidType, \"invalid channel type %T\", channel) } bz, err := k.cdc.Marshal(&channelEnd) if err != nil { return err } if err := clientState.VerifyMembership( ctx, clientStore, k.cdc, height, 0, 0, // skip delay period checks for non-packet processing verification proof, merklePath, bz, ); err != nil { return sdkerrors.Wrapf(err, \"failed channel state verification for client (%s)\", clientID) }","s":"ClientState interface changes","u":"/v9.0.x/migrations/v6-to-v7/","h":"/v9.0.x/migrations/v6-to-v7/#clientstate-interface-changes","p":2201},{"i":2217,"t":"exported.Header and exported.Misbehaviour interface types have been merged and renamed to ClientMessage interface.

The light client module implementation for 07-tendermint may also be useful as reference.","s":"API removals","u":"/v9.0.x/migrations/v8-to-v9/","h":"/v9.0.x/migrations/v8-to-v9/#api-removals-1","p":2292},{"i":2328,"t":"The Initialize, Status, GetTimestampAtHeight and UpdateStateOnMisbehaviour functions in ClientState have been removed and all their logic has been moved to functions of the LightClientModule.
